In order to hook up to the target process you need to retrieve its process ID (PID).
  You can find the process ID by opening the Windows Task Manager under "Details" and "Services".
  If a process ID is not listet there you can use Cheat Engine.
    - On the process list you can find an 8-digit hex number infront of every processes name.
    - convert it to decimal and you have gotten the required PID.
  Back on the Lynx Code Manager paste the PID into the corresponding text line on the bottom and click "Open Process".
  Certain elements should now become enabled.
  
  Add new cheat file
    - click the "New Cheat File" button to open a dialog to enter a name for your cheat file. It will be saved under "C:\users\<username>\documents\Lynx Code Manager\Cheat Files\"
    - Now click "Add New Cheat" to add a cheat to the list box.
    - You can now name it, add the cheat (watch the code type documentation) and give more details
    - IF YOU HAVE ONLY ONE CHEAT IN THE LIST AND WANT TO SAVE IT SELECT IT BEFORE CLICKING ON "Save Edits". THERE'S A BUG THAT WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM. (going to fix that soon)
    - Save any edits before you want to apply them.
